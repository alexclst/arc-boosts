# Arc Boosts

This repository contains the boosts that I have put together for the [Arc web browser](https://arc.net/).

* [Dark mode for Google Docs](docs.dark.css): This does not affect the main Google Drive, since I primarily use the desktop app to navigate my Drive and rarely see the main website.
* [Dark mode for Bitbucket](bitbucket.dark.css)
* [Dark mode for Jira](jira.dark.css)
* [MainWP](mainwp.css): Hides the update all buttons and makes the icons on the security and external changes widgets (when none are detected) smaler.
* [Simpler design for WP-Kama](wpkama.css)
