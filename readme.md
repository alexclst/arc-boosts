# Arc Boosts

This repository contains the legacy boosts that I had put together for the [Arc web browser](https://arc.net/). As of 25 May 2023 Arc introduced the [Boost Gallery](https://arc.net/boosts) which is now the place I will be publicizing any boosts in the future. This repository remains as an archive.

Lagacy boosts:
* [Dark mode for Google Docs](docs.dark.css): This does not affect the main Google Drive, since I primarily use the desktop app to navigate my Drive and rarely see the main website.
* [Dark mode for Bitbucket](bitbucket.dark.css)
* [Dark mode for Jira](jira.dark.css)
* [MainWP](mainwp.css): Hides the update all buttons and makes the icons on the security and external changes widgets (when none are detected) smaler.
